# Fashion MNIST object classification

The objective of this case study is the object classification using Fashion MNIST Dataset which contain 60000 instances. For object classification two deep learning algorithms have been used, basic ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network. By using CNN we have got 97% training accuracy while 92% of testing accuracy.




## Dataset

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of clothing images. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The 10 classes represent different types of clothing, such as T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, and ankle boot.



## Methods

Two neural network algorithms have been used for this work, ANN and CNN. Hyperparameter tuning have performed for the the hyperparameters of ANN algorithms. for image classifcation CNN have performed better than the ANN.



## Hyperparameter tuning

For hyperparameter tuning RandomizedSearchCV from sklearn is used. Hyperparameters such as number of layers, number of hidden layers, learning rate, epoches, and batch size are tuned from the sequential ANN.
